This short project implements a linear regression from scratch for the Boston Housing dataset.
It compares the analytical solution for the problem with a numerical solution, given via gradient descent.
There are two implementations for training the model with gradient descent, the first runs for a fixed number of steps, while the second runs until convergence of the models L^2 loss.
