#### Description
This short project implements a linear regression model from scratch for the Boston Housing dataset.  
The code is entirely original and written by me.

The project implements the analytical solution and a numerical solution, given via gradient descent.  

- The analytical solution is given by $\theta = (X^T  X)^{-1}  X^T y$
- Gradient descent is implemented in two versions.  
The first runs for a fixed number of steps, while the second runs until convergence of the models $L^2$ loss.
